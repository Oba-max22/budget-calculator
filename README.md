# budget-calculator

You have been tasked to design an automated budget calculator. Your main objective is to collect information about a person in a form. The result is then generated based on the data that has been collected from the person in the form.

You are expected to work with these data: income, age, gender, marital status, and the number of dependents. You are free to make useful assumptions where necessary. 

Result: a formatted page showing at least 10 budget categories and their percentage and naira amounts. 


Important: Develop your mockup with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Share a GitHub link to your final project.
